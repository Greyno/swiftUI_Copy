# Example of Passing Data (copy)
This application updates the swiftUI_Sample app, by no longer using a 'Text' view that displays the first name on the (main) Simple View screen but instead using a 'FirstNameView' that does the same thing. However, adding this FirstNameView causes the DetailView to crash on deletion of an item on the (main) Simple View screen. The crash is due to "Fatal error: Index out of range: file Swift/ContiguousArrayBuffer.swift, line 444". The error suggests that an array in a view is no longer in synch with the data changes. The code changes made are not following the expected SwiftUI behaviour of keeping data aligned - the code as developed is fighting the normal operation of the SwiftUI framework.
